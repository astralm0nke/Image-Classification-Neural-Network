# Image-Classification-Neural-Network
This is a simple neural network from scratch that predicts handwritten digits from 0-9.\n
It uses the MNIST Handwritten Numbers Dataset\n
Jupyter Notebook\n
Epoch=2, 1 hidden layer w nodes=200, sigmoid activation\n
There's no keras, tensorflow, etc., just vanilla python\n
Z= about 95% accuracy\n
Based off "Make Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid, an excellent intro into the math and code for deep learning with python that I used to first learn about the subject. Prob one of the best resources I've personally found on the subject for people learning python.\n
Enjoy!:)
